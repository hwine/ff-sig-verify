============
Installation
============

The primary use of this package is as a lambda function. Preparing a zip
file for upload to AWS is done via ``make``. The default target is the
zip file for upload. See the :ref:`AWS Lambda documentation
<installation-on-aws>` for additional
information on installing it.



There are also some locally useful utilities which can be installed. At
the command line::

    pip install fx-sig-verify[cli]

That provides the following scripts:

``fx-sig-verify``:
    Command line version of the lambda function. Can be used to check
    local files. It outputs the pass/fail status of the file.

``analyze_cloudwatch``:
    Performs analysis on the CloudWatch logs generated by the lambda
    function. It can perform simple analysis, or extract lines of
    interest for further processing.

``print-pe-certs``:
    This script is from the original code, and is the source of the
    logic for the lambda function. It will print out the certificate
    chain for any file.
